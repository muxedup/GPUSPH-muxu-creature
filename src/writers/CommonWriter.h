#ifndef H_COMMONWRITER_H
#define H_COMMONWRITER_H

/* The CommonWriter is a Writer dedicated to saving time series of common
 * aggregated data related to the particle system, such as its total energy,
 * the wavegages, etc.
 * It is independent of all other writers, active by default, and by default
 * writes a datapoint every time any other writer also writes (i.e. it doesn't
 * have a frequency of its own). It is of course possible to override this
 * behavior by setting its frequency to a finite value (e.g. 0 to write at
 * every timestep, a negative value to disable it, or a positive value to
 * write with a fixed frequency) in the problem.
 * The files created by the CommonWriter should all follow the following format:
 *
 * 0. tab separated
 * 1. a header on the first row (column titles)
 * 2. the simulation time should always be the first column
 * 3. one row per time point
 *
 * This makes it easy to import these files into common tools, and trivial
 * to plot them with e.g. gnuplot
