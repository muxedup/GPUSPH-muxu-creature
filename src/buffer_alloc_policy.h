/* Buffer allocation policy: a class that determines, for each buffer,
 * how many copies are needed. This generally depends on the integration
 * scheme used, and potentially also at least the formulation (e.g.
 * a formulation where the particle volume evolves might need a double
 * buffer for the particle volume, while if a summation-density formulation
 * is used, a single copy of the particle volume buffer would suffice).
