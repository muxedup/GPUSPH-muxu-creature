		\defgroup neibs Neighbor search
		<p>The neighbor search is done trough a walk in a neighbor list consisting
		of the indices of each neighbors of each particles.</p>
		<p>Actually we use a more compact format where instead of storing neighbors 
		indices (size of uint) we store their relative (size ushort) indices respect 
		to the cells they belong to. One other consequence of this choice is to simplify 
		the periodic boundatries treatment.</p>
		<p>The construction of the neighbor list is basically a 3 steps process :
		<ol>
			<li> computing particle hash values </li>
			<li> reordering all particle datas according to the previuoly computed hash </li>
			<li> construct the list of compacted neighbor indices </li>
		</ol>
